# 👋 Hello, I'm Harris!

I'm a **Gameplay Systems Engineer & Software Developer**, passionate about designing and implementing gameplay systems, mechanics, and tools. I love working on anything and everything that interests me, particularly anything that has to do with tools and design!

![whatscooking](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f436d68-90e8-4718-8116-09f58ebf29d4)

I studied Computer Science with a personal commitment on Software Engineering & Artificial Intelligence, and I've dedicated my efforts to developing gameplay mechanics, tools, and systems that inspire awe through my work.

What I'm currently working on:
- **[Primal Dominion: Aftermath](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1552190/Primal_Dominion_Aftermath/)** — a tactical dinosaur vs. human first-person-shooter, showcases my holistic skillset in game development.
- **[Transience](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124100/Transience/)** — a story-driven first-person stealth shooter, my role involves UI/UX implementation and design.

My engineering roots are grounded in C++ and Unreal Engine, where I build performant and optimised gameplay systems with a focus on scalability and player experience. Whilst I am an Engine Programmer in the day, I moonlight as a relentless idea explorer, I love crafting anything that excites me, no matter the tech stack. Whether it's gameplay systems, dev tools, or experimental projects.

Along the way, I’ve expanded my skillset by working with:

- **Python**, for machine learning, data science, and tool scripting.

- **JavaScript**, for building interactive sites and full-stack apps.

- **Tools** like Git, Perforce, IntelliJ, Adobe Cloud Suite, and more to streamline my workflow.

My experience also spans academic AI applications such as my Bsc Project and Diseased Guava Fruit Image Detection.
I embody a holistic approach, doesn't matter the task, **if there's a way, I'll see to it!**
