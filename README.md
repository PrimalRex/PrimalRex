# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Harris!

I'm a **Tools Engineer & Software Developer**, passionate about designing and implementing gameplay systems, mechanics, and tools. I love working on anything and everything that interests me, particularly anything that has to do with tools and design!

![whatscooking](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f436d68-90e8-4718-8116-09f58ebf29d4)

I studied a BSc in Computer Science with a personal commitment on Software Engineering & Artificial Intelligence, and I've dedicated my efforts to developing gameplay mechanics, tools, and systems that inspire awe through my work.

Along the way, Iâ€™ve expanded my skillset by working with:

- **Python**, for machine learning, data science, apps and tool scripting.

- **JavaScript**, for building interactive sites and full-stack apps.

- **Tools** like Git, Perforce, IntelliJ, Adobe Cloud Suite, and more to streamline my workflow.
  
- Academic AI applications such as my BSc project and Guava Fruit Image Detection to further broaden my experiential reach.
  
I embody a holistic approach, doesn't matter the task, **if there's a way, I'll see to it!**
