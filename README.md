# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Harris!

I'm a **Game Systems Engineer & Software Developer**, passionate about designing and implementing gameplay systems, mechanics, and tools. I love working on anything and everything that interests me, particularly anything that has to do with tools and design!

![whatscooking](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f436d68-90e8-4718-8116-09f58ebf29d4)

I studied for a BSc in Computer Science with a personal commitment on Software Engineering & Artificial Intelligence, and I've dedicated my efforts to developing gameplay mechanics, tools, and systems that inspire awe through my work.

What I'm currently working on:
- **[Primal Dominion: Aftermath](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1552190/Primal_Dominion_Aftermath/)** â€” a tactical dinosaur vs. human first-person-shooter, showcases my holistic skillset in game development.
- **[Transience](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124100/Transience/)** â€” a story-driven first-person stealth shooter, my role involves UI/UX implementation and design.
- Various small experiments and learning projects.

My engineering roots are grounded in C++ and Unreal Engine, where I build performant and optimised gameplay systems with a focus on scalability and player experience. Whilst I am an Engine Programmer in the day, I moonlight as a relentless idea explorer, I love crafting anything that excites me, no matter the tech stack. Whether it's gameplay systems, dev tools, or experimental projects.

Along the way, Iâ€™ve expanded my skillset by working with:

- **Python**, for machine learning, data science, apps and tool scripting.

- **JavaScript**, for building interactive sites and full-stack apps.

- **Tools** like Git, Perforce, IntelliJ, Adobe Cloud Suite, and more to streamline my workflow.
  
- Academic AI applications such as my BSc project and Guava Fruit Image Detection to further broaden my experiential reach.
  
I embody a holistic approach, doesn't matter the task, **if there's a way, I'll see to it!**
